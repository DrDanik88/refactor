  # Challenge 1 Webpage

## This challenged was to refactor code that was quite messy and vague. The result? A nice code, working links and a small website loading images.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I was motivated to refactor the code so that I can use semantic HTML instead of just divs and classes.
- I built this project because it was important for me to understand the differences between a generic code and a more descriptive one. I have included comments to help guide you within the CSS and the HTML file.
- It didn't solve a problem per say. It was more of a learning experience.
- I had the chance to learn the difference between non-semantic and semantic code. Plus, I learned how to make the code flow by section and how to order it in a way that it can be read.
